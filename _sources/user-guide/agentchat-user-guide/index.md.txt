      User Guide for AgentChat, a high-level API for AutoGen
---

# AgentChat

AgentChat is a high-level API for building multi-agent applications.
It is built on top of the [`autogen-core`](../core-user-guide/index.md) package.
For beginner users, AgentChat is the recommended starting point.
For advanced users, [`autogen-core`](../core-user-guide/index.md)'s event-driven
programming model provides more flexibility and control over the underlying components.

AgentChat aims to provide intuitive defaults, such as **Agents** with preset
behaviors and **Teams** with predefined [multi-agent design patterns](../core-user-guide/design-patterns/index.md).
to simplify building multi-agent applications.

```{tip}
If you are interested in implementing complex agent interaction behaviours, defining custom messaging protocols, or orchestration mechanisms, consider using the [ `autogen-core`](../core-user-guide/index.md) package.
